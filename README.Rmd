`rCTA` is an R interfact to access the APIs of Chicago Transit Authority(CTA) in order to get real-time information of buses and help users  make empowered decisions about their trip.The APIs include **Bus Tracker API** and **Customer Alerts API**. Check out the documentations here:

[Bus Tracker API Documentation](https://www.transitchicago.com/assets/1/6/cta_Bus_Tracker_API_Developer_Guide_and_Documentation_20160929.pdf)


[Customer Alerts API Documentation](https://www.transitchicago.com/developers/alerts/)

## APIs in rCTA

There are two API contained in this package: 

* **Bus Tracker API:** This API allows developers to request and retrieve the real-time information of buses. 
Data available through the API includes: 
     + Vehicle locations
     + Route data (route lists, stop lists geo-positional route definitions, etc.)
     + Prediction Data
     + Service Bulletins

* **Customer Alerts API:** This API allows developers to get detailed information about current alerts. Data available through the API includes: 
    + Route status
    + Detailed alerts


## API Authentication
You will need an API key to interact with **Bus Tracker API** on every requrest (Customer Alerts API does not need Authentication). To become authorized, follow the instructions below:

**1. Get an API key**

* Sign up and activate your account at [Bus Tracker Sign up](http://www.ctabustracker.com/bustime/createAccount.jsp).
* Sign into [Bus Tracker Sign in](http://www.ctabustracker.com/bustime/login.jsp).
* Choose on My Account in the upper right-hand corner of the page.
* Follow the link under "Developer API" to apply.

**2. Store your API key**

Once you obtain an API key, we encourage you to store it in the `.Renviron` file which is loaded during R's startup. 

First, find your R Home directory:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
R.home(component = "home")
```

Then, open the the file `Renviron.site` and add the Bus Tracker API keys with the following lines:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
BUS_CLIENT_KEY = THE_API_KEY_HERE
```

## Installation and Setup

You can install the released version of rCTA from **CRAN** with:

```{r, eval=FALSE }
install.packages("rCTA")
```
Or, development version from **GitHub**:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
devtools::install_github("ytingc/rCTA")
```
Then, you can load rCTA package to play with:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(rCTA)
```

## Basic Features of rCTA pacakge

**Search Stops**

Search for stop information. Useful when stop_id is unkown. You can specify bus number, and/or stop name, and/or direciton. For example: 

```{r echo=TRUE}
lookupstop(bus = 1, stopname = "Indiana", dir = "Northbound")
```


**Set up favorite route**

Get real-time information of your favorite route. You can obtain estimated arrival time, waiting time, travel time, delay and alert message. It also allows users to collect and save the real-time information for a given period in a data frame through calling the function periodically. Note that it is a real-time data, it may generate error message"No service scheduled" when your request time is out of operation.

**Get an Overview of Current Bus Alerts**

Obtain an overview of current alerts of all CTA buses through a summary table that provide the count of each type of alerts.
```{r echo=TRUE}
alertstat()
```

## Vignettes

Detailed information about functions can be otained through the following:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# search for stop information
vignette("lookupstop", package = "rCTA")
```

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# set up my favorite route
vignette("myfavrt", package = "rCTA")
```

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# get statistical information of alerts
vignette("alertstat", package = "rCTA")
```
